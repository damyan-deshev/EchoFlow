# EchoFlow

### A local-first Android AI workspace

Two surfaces — Chat for conversation, Imagine for images and video. Local models, custom endpoints, web search, deep research, agents, artifacts. No backend, no account, no telemetry.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Direction of this fork

The working assumption here is that the phone is the interface and can choose where inference runs.
EchoFlow can talk directly to keyless OpenAI-compatible and TTS services on a trusted local network,
and Supertonic speech synthesis can also run fully on-device through MNN/OpenCL.

Current fork-specific work includes:

- editable system prompts, with assembled safe defaults or a complete raw override, globally and
  per conversation;
- keyless OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints on localhost or a private LAN, while authenticated and
  internet-facing endpoints remain HTTPS-only;
- streaming-style read-aloud: text is split into ordered chunks, Supertonic returns independent WAV
  segments, and Media3 plays them as a live queue instead of waiting for one complete file;
- selectable on-device or remote Supertonic, with shared voice, language, speed, quality steps and
  phrase-silence settings;
- a pinned, hash-verified on-device model download and persistent OpenCL kernel cache. The model is
  deliberately not committed to Git.

The on-device provider currently targets arm64 Android phones. Its first uncached run compiles GPU
kernels; later launches reuse an app-private cache. See [third-party notices](docs/third-party.md)
for the pinned runtime, implementation provenance and model revision.

Local inference is treated as fallible rather than merely complete when a WAV file exists. EchoFlow
measures every generated PCM stream, rejects silent or implausibly short output, retries in a clean
MNN runtime, and adaptively splits only a persistently failing text chunk. The recovered pieces stay
as independent items in the same ordered Media3 playlist. The investigation and measured Pixel vs
Strix evidence are recorded in [the on-device execution record](docs/work/on-device-supertonic.md).

The defaults reflect the maintainer's own LAN and devices. Every address exposed by the fork is a
runtime setting, not a claim that the same topology will suit another installation.

## What it is

EchoFlow is a native Android app for talking to AI models — your way. There's no EchoFlow server sitting in the middle: you bring your own API keys, point it at your own Ollama box, or skip the network entirely and run a model on your phone. Nothing you type gets logged anywhere except your own device.

It started as a chat app and grew into a small workspace: web search, background research, structured data extraction, a controllable browser, generated documents, and a few ways to make multiple models work together.

## Why people use it

| | |
|---|---|
| **Nothing leaves your control** | No EchoFlow backend, no account, no analytics. Conversations, keys, and settings live on your device. |
| **Any model you want** | OpenRouter, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Cerebras, Sarvam, a local Ollama server, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or fully offline on-device models. |
| **More than chat** | Web search, deep research with citations, structured data extraction, browser automation, and document generation, built around whichever model you're using. |
| **Models working together** | Have one model consult a stronger one mid-answer, run several models in parallel and let a judge synthesize the results, or hand a model its own tools and a worker to delegate to. |

## Quick start

```text
1. Install the APK from Releases.
2. Open Settings and connect a model:
     - Models           -> OpenRouter & on-device
     - Custom           -> OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Cerebras, Sarvam, xAI
     - Anything else    -> Echo Labs -> Custom API Endpoint
3. Start chatting.
```

No keys are required just to install and look around — on-device models work fully offline.

## Connecting a model

| Provider | Where to set it up | Attachments |
|---|---|---|
| OpenRouter | Settings → Models | Images/PDFs, depending on the model |
| OpenAI · Claude · Gemini · Cerebras · xAI | Settings → Custom | Images and PDFs (Cerebras: Gemma-family images only) |
| Sarvam | Settings → Custom → Sarvam | Text chat with Sarvam 105B; Saaras v4 dictation |
| Ollama (local/LAN) | Echo Labs → Custom API Endpoint → Ollama API | Per-model toggle |
| OpenAI-compatible (LM Studio, Jan, vLLM, LocalAI…) | Echo Labs → Custom API Endpoint | Per-model toggle |
| On-device (LiteRT / MediaPipe) | Settings → Models → On-device | `.litertlm` models only |

Enable Sarvam and save your API key under **Settings → Custom → Sarvam**. `sarvam-105b` is preselected for the chat model picker. To use its speech recognition, choose **Saaras v4** under **Settings → Dictation**. Dictation uses the selected provider’s key independently of the chat model; longer recordings are split to fit Sarvam’s 30-second request limit.

Web search (Exa, Parallel, Firecrawl) and OpenRouter's own server-side search work across every provider above except where noted.

## What you can do with it

**Chat** — streaming responses, markdown, code highlighting, reasoning traces, citations, and model switching mid-conversation. Chat and Imagine keep separate histories; conversations that predate the split stay in Chat.

**Web search** — toggle it per message or set a default. OpenRouter's search only works with OpenRouter models; Exa, Parallel, and Firecrawl work with anything.

**Deep research** — a background mode for questions that need real investigation. Runs notify you of progress, survive interruption, and come back as a cited report with sections and tables.

**Data Agent** — point it at a page or task and get structured output (prices, specs, contacts) instead of prose, with a visible credit budget.

**Browser Flow** — a live browser session that chat can drive across multiple turns, with confirmation prompts before it visits a new domain or sends anything.

**Artifacts** — generate and revise self-contained pages, reports, and documents, versioned as you iterate.

**Imagine** — a separate surface for making things. Describe an image and edit it conversationally ("make the sky purple"), or describe a short clip and get it back as video. Shape, model and audio live beside the prompt; results are presented as a contact sheet rather than a chat log. Rendering a clip takes minutes, so it keeps going with the app closed and picks itself back up if the app is killed mid-render — you choose the shape, the model chooses the length. See [docs/modes.md](docs/modes.md) and [docs/video-generation.md](docs/video-generation.md).

**Echo Adviser** — let your model call in a stronger or more specialized model mid-answer when it's stuck.

**Echo Fusion** — run several models on the same prompt and have a judge model compare and merge their answers.

**Echo Agents** — give a model its own search/fetch tools plus a cheaper worker model to delegate sub-tasks to.

## Running models on-device

EchoFlow can run models entirely offline using LiteRT-LM and MediaPipe:

- A curated catalog of mobile-ready models
- Hugging Face search for `.task` and `.litertlm` files
- Importing your own model files
- Token support for gated Hugging Face models
- No internet connection or API key required once a model is downloaded

## Built with

Kotlin and Jetpack Compose (Material 3 Expressive), targeting Android 24+. Networking via OkHttp/Retrofit, persistence via Room, on-device inference via LiteRT-LM and MediaPipe GenAI, search and research via Exa/Parallel/Firecrawl/OpenRouter, markdown rendering via a custom Compose renderer.
